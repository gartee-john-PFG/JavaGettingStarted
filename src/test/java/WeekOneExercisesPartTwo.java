      calculate your Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)

      The weight quotient is 5.14 divided by the person's weight in pounds.
      The alcohol distribution ratio is 0.73 for men and 0.66 for women.
      The peak alcohol content is the product of the weight quotient, ounces of alcohol consumed, and the
      alcohol distribution ratio.
      The last consumption interval is the product of the hours since the last drink and 0.015.

      The Blood Alcohol Content is the difference between the peak alcohol content and the last consumption interval.
